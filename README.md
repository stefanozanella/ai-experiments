Neural Network-powered Monitoring Engine
========================================

This project presents a monitoring engine determining system status using an
Artificial Neural Network. It fetches data out of a Graphite installation and
publishes the result of the monitoring on a WebSocket URL.

NOTE
----

**Project is still in early-development phase. Currently, it just serves as a
proof of concept, since most of the configurable parameters are hardcoded in
the scripts.**
